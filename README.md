# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# imorts and exports\
Two types which we are going to use 
1) Default import/exports
2) named imports/exports
3) React Hooks : useState,useEffect

#useEffect
there are two arugments first is callback function (compulsary) and second is dependency array (optional)
#case 1 : empty dependancy array : useEffect is called only once after inital render
#case 2 : no dependency array : useEffect is called after every render
#case 3 : dependency array with dependencies : useEffect is called after dependencies are changed

#useState :It is react hook to define and update state variables=> javascript function

1) structure : const [name, method(optional)] = useState(initialvalue)

#useEffect : It is react hook to handle sideEffects

 structure : useEffect(callback function, dependency array(optional))

three cases : 
1) empty dependency array ([]) : useEffect is called only once after initial render
2) no dependency array () :  useEffect is called after initial render and after every successive render
3) dependency array with dependencies ([state1, state2]) :useEffect is called after initial render and after every change in either of dependencies
